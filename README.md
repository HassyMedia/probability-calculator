Probability Calculator

Project Overview
This project features a Python-based probability calculator. It simulates drawing balls of different colors from a hat and calculates the probability of drawing a specific combination of balls. The project is structured with a Hat class to represent the hat filled with balls of different colors, and an experiment function to simulate the drawing process and calculate probabilities.

Features

Hat class to represent a hat filled with balls of different colors.
Method to draw a specified number of balls randomly from the hat.
Function to perform repeated experiments for probability calculation.
Installation
No additional installation is required for this project. It uses Python's standard libraries, particularly random.

Usage
To use the probability calculator, import the Hat class and the experiment function into your Python script.

Testing
The project includes an example usage that demonstrates how to initialize a Hat object, set up an experiment, and calculate the probability.
